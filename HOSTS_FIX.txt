Use erp.dincouture.pk on your PC (DNS workaround)
================================================

EASIEST: Run PowerShell as Administrator, then:
  cd "C:\Users\ndm31\dev\Corusr\NEW POSV3"
  .\scripts\windows-hosts-fix.ps1
Then open: https://erp.dincouture.pk

MANUAL: Add this line to: C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
  72.62.254.176 erp.dincouture.pk
IMPORTANT: Save the file as "hosts" (NO .txt extension). Then: ipconfig /flushdns

If still NXDOMAIN: Close all browsers, try "ping erp.dincouture.pk" (should show 72.62.254.176).
Some antivirus/DNS tools block hosts file - try disabling or add exception.

See docs/FIX_ERP_DOMAIN_NOW.md for full steps and permanent DNS fix.
