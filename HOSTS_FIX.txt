Add this line to your Windows hosts file to use erp.dincouture.pk immediately (DNS workaround):

72.62.254.176 erp.dincouture.pk

File: C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
Open Notepad as Administrator → Open that file → paste line at end → Save.
Then: ipconfig /flushdns
Then open: https://erp.dincouture.pk

See docs/FIX_ERP_DOMAIN_NOW.md for full steps and permanent DNS fix.
